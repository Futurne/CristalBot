# CristalBot
Cristal d'Azur discord bot.

Randomly reply to messages in discord channels.
It uses previous scrapped data to create sentences with
a simple markov chain. The sentence are not corrects, but often
the results are funny enough.

It also uses a Variational AutoEncoder to generate anime faces.
The Pytorch model isn't in the repo, if you want it you can ping me.
